### **Superstore Sales EDA - Technical Report**

**1. Project Objective**

This project involved a complete *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* of the Superstore Sales dataset. The goal was to systematically apply *data cleaning*, *feature engineering*, and *visualization* to identify key performance metrics and data-driven patterns. The final output is a **reusable** Jupyter Notebook that documents the entire process.

**2. Methodology Overview**

The analysis followed a structured workflow:

*   **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Initial data was scanned for quality issues. The process included *deduplication*, *date normalization*, correction of logical errors, *imputation* of nulls, *PII masking*, and *standardization* of categorical data. All modifications were tracked by row and order ID count.
*   **Feature Engineering:** The cleaned dataset was enriched with new features to support analysis, including `Total Sales`, `Total Profit`, `Original Price`, `Shipping Urgency`, `Days Since Last Order`, and customer-level aggregates.
*   **Outlier Handling and Segmentation:** A function was implemented to remove statistical *outliers* from `Sales Price` and `Profit` using the **3*IQR rule**. Customers were then segmented into *quintiles* based on aggregated sales and profit data.
*   **Visualization and Analysis:** The prepared data was used to generate a series of plots and pivot tables to address the specific analytical questions from the case study.

**3. Key Findings**

**Sales and Profit Structure**
*   The top 10 most profitable products contribute only **5.1%** to total positive profit, indicating a *diversified profit base*. In contrast, the top 10 loss-making products are responsible for **18.8%** of total losses, showing **high loss concentration**.
*   The business operates on a *high volume of low-value sales*. The profit distribution is centered near zero with a significant negative tail, indicating that *unprofitable transactions* are a frequent and systemic occurrence.
*   A *positive correlation* exists between sales and profit, but profit variance increases with sales value (*heteroscedasticity*), meaning **high-value transactions carry higher risk**.

**Segment and Category Performance**
*   The `Consumer` segment buying `Office Supplies` generates the highest *absolute profit* (**$134k**), while the `Home Office` segment buying `Office Supplies` is the most *efficient*, with the highest *profit margin* (**21.7%**).
*   A data-driven role for each category was identified: **`Office Supplies`** is the high-efficiency volume driver (low price, high margin), **`Technology`** is the absolute profit driver (high price, moderate margin), and **`Furniture`** is an inefficient revenue driver (high price, low margin).

**Logistics and Regional Performance**
*   `Standard Class` shipping is the dominant method by volume and total profit in all regions. No significant correlation was found between *shipping urgency* and *per-order profitability*.
*   The **`West`** region is the top performer, and national performance is highly dependent on **`California`**, the most profitable state.
*   Two distinct state-level models were observed: a *low-volume/high-margin* model in smaller markets and a *high-volume/lower-margin* model in larger ones.

**Discount Impact**
*   A **strong negative correlation** exists between the `Discount` level and `Total Profit`. A profitability **"tipping point"** was identified at a **~20% discount**, beyond which transactions are predominantly unprofitable.
*   The most aggressive proportional discounts are applied to the "Binders," "Chairs," and "Bookcases" sub-categories, directly linking the **`Furniture`** category to *margin erosion*.

**Temporal Trends**
*   Significant business activity in the dataset is confined to the **2014-2017** period.
*   A **strong seasonal pattern** exists, with sales and profit consistently peaking in **Q4** and reaching a trough in Q1.
*   *Year-over-year sales growth* accelerated annually, while profit growth fluctuated, indicating a trade-off between **margin expansion (2015)** and **sales growth prioritization (2016-2017)**.

**4. Technical Challenges and Solutions**

*   *Logical data errors*, such as negative sales prices and invalid shipping dates, were corrected by taking the absolute value or nullifying the records.
*   *Erroneous outlier dates* (1999, 2029) were handled by programmatically filtering the dataset to the primary period of activity (2014-2017) before temporal analysis.
*   *Inconsistent categorical data* in the `State` column was standardized using string stripping and a replacement map, then validated against a canonical list.
*   The original `Ship Mode` column was found to be *unreliable*, which justified the engineering of a more robust `Shipping Urgency` feature.
*   An incorrect formula for the `Original Price` feature was identified and corrected through **visual validation**, highlighting the importance of an iterative analytical workflow.

**5. Data-Driven Conclusions**

1.  The discount policy is the single largest driver of unprofitability. Discounts over **20%** consistently lead to net losses.
2.  The **`Furniture`** category is a systemic underperformer, characterized by high price points but the lowest profit margins.
3.  The company's financial stability comes from the high-efficiency, high-volume sale of **`Office Supplies`**.
4.  The **`Technology`** category, while having moderate margins, is the key to generating large absolute profit from high-value sales.
